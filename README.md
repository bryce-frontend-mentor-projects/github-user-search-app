## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My Process

Probably making this more complicated than I needed to. But I wanted practice using styled components, etc and this seemed like
a good opportunity to do that. Also, get some experience with different data fetching libs, such as SWR.

### Progress

- [x] Mobile styling.
- [ ] Tablet styling.
- [ ] Desktop styling.
- [ ] Fix issue with "No results" formatting in mobile.
- [x] Actual data fetching from github
- [ ] Add links to appropriate places
